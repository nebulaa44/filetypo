# filetypo

FileTypo is a command line tool that will attempt to give the file type of a given file.

## Note

FileTypo will most likely **NEVER** be production ready. This app should only be used for testing purposes.

You can check what file types are supported by viewing `docs/SUPPORTED_FILE_TYPES.txt`.
